Profile: KT2_RelatedPerson
Parent: NlcoreContactPerson
Description: "

## Overview

The RelatedPerson resource represents an individual who has a personal or professional relationship with a patient and may be involved in their care. This includes family members, caregivers, legal guardians, and other support persons who assist in the patient's therapy and treatment. The profile extends the NlcoreContactPerson profile with Koppeltaal-specific requirements.

## Relationship

The relationship(s) that the `Patient` has with the `RelatedPerson` can be documented using various code systems. A `Patient` can maintain multiple relationship types with a `RelatedPerson`.

Example:
```json
{
  \"relationship\": [
    {
      \"coding\": [
        {
          \"system\": \"http://terminology.h17.org/Codesystem/v3-RoleCode\",
          \"code\": \"MTH\",
          \"display\": \"Mother\"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      \"coding\": [
        {
          \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.22.472\",
          \"code\": \"21\",
          \"display\": \"CliÃ«ntondersteuner\"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Patient Reference

The `patient` element contains the reference to the `Patient` to which the given `RelatedPerson` is linked:

```json
{
  \"patient\": {
    \"reference\": \"Patient/${PatientID}\"
  }
}
```

## Required Elements

The following elements are mandatory:
- `identifier` - At least one identifier for the related person
- `active` - Indicates whether the record is in active use
- `patient` - Reference to the associated KT2_Patient
- `relationship` - At least one relationship code
- `name` - Name information following Dutch conventions
- `gender` - Gender of the related person
- `birthDate` - Birth date of the related person

## Validation Warnings

Due to an issue with the FHIR profile, validation warnings may be generated for the `KT2_RelatedPerson` resource:

> This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile

These warnings should be ignored when the creation or update of the resource is successful. Focus on actual errors in the `OperationOutcome` resource rather than these informational warnings."

A Dutch name is represented in FHIR as an ordinary international name, but is augmented using extensions to specify how the last name is built up according to the Dutch rules. See the guidance on `.family` and on `.extension:nameUsage` for more information. Systems that need to work in a Dutch context **MUST** support these extensions as specified here. In addition, systems **MUST** use the core elements according to the FHIR specifications to provide compatibility outside Dutch contexts. It is encouraged to provide a representation of the full name in the `.text` element.\r\n\r\n**Note 1**: The zib cannot be represented straightforward in FHIR. Especially note the guidance on `.given` on how to map the FirstNames and Initials concepts, and on `.prefix`/`.suffix` on how to map the Titles concept.\r\n\r\n**Note 2**: This element should only contain a person's _official_ names. The GivenName concept is represented in another `.name` element with `.name.use` = _usual_.\r\n\r\n**Note 3**: The examples illustrate how the zib is mapped to FHIR."
